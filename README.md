# Cryptography - University of Maryland, College Park (Jonathan Katz) - Coursera

Solutions of weekly assignments to practice Go.

## Week 1: [Breaking the Vigenere cipher][w1]

Write a program that allows you to "crack" ciphertexts generated using a Vigenere-like cipher, where byte-wise XOR is used instead of addition modulo 26.

## Week 2: [Breaking the One Time Pad][w2]

Below are 7 ciphertexts, each of which was generated by encrypting some 31-character ASCII plaintext with the one-time pad using the same key (code for the encryption program used is given below). Decrypt them and recover all 7 plaintexts, each of which is a grammatically correct English sentence.
