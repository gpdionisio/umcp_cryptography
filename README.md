# Cryptography - University of Maryland, College Park (Jonathan Katz) - Coursera

Solutions of weekly assignments to practice Go.

## Week 1: [Breaking the Vigenere cipher][w1]

Write a program that allows you to "crack" ciphertexts generated using a Vigenere-like cipher, where byte-wise XOR is used instead of addition modulo 26.

## Week 2: [Breaking the One Time Pad][w2]

Below are 7 ciphertexts, each of which was generated by encrypting some 31-character ASCII plaintext with the one-time pad using the same key (code for the encryption program used is given below).
Decrypt them and recover all 7 plaintexts, each of which is a grammatically correct English sentence.

## Week 3: [Padding Oracle Attacks][w3]

In this assignment, you must decrypt a challenge ciphertext generated using AES in CBC-mode with PKCS #7 padding. To do so, you will be given access to a server that will decrypt any ciphertexts you send it (using the same key that was used to generate the challenge ciphertext)...but that will only tell you whether or not decryption results in an error!
